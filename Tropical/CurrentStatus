---------------
- Polyhedra
---------------

We need to get Lars to implement the change we made in constructors.m2
to the fanFromGfan command.

Ideally we'd also get him to implement some version of "apply this
linear transformation to a fan" (emailed about this on 15/6/17).


---------------
- gfanInterface2
---------------

There are three errors left.  Two of them have comments attached, and
the work that is needed is to understand how to handle gfan output
that is a PolyhedralCone.  The other I (DM) don't understand yet.

There's also a lot of commented out stuff that we should probably delete
(after checking tests) and also some other things that we should comment
out (e.g, checking for keys in hash tables that no longer exist).

We're also waiting for Ben Madley's changes to this.

Problem when the output of gfan is empty.

---------------
- Tropical 
---------------

Status of functions:

- We'd still like to implement for someone to be able to choose their
  favourite complementary subspace to the lineality space.

- Still need to implement stable intersection for gfan (using the new gfan).


Status of documentation:

- "Getting Started" page for first time users
- Benefits over gfan



Status of tests:

-needed tests for fan,cones,isBalanced(it needs
polymake),stableIntersection(note that it needs the new
gfan),findMultiplicities,
findMultiplicity,computeCones,isPure,isSimplicial,convertToPolymake

-more tests for tropicalVariety especially non homogeneous case
