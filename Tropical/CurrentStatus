---------------
- Polyhedra
---------------

- Get Lars to implement some version of "apply this linear transformation
  to a fan" (emailed about this on 15/6/17).

---------------
- gfanInterface2
---------------

Status of code:

- There's also a lot of commented out stuff that we should probably delete
  (after checking tests) and also some other things that we should comment
  out (e.g, checking for keys in hash tables that no longer exist).

- Output of gfanParseIdeal returns a a Macaulay2 list and not an ideal
  (Magda: I can take care of it)

- check the multiplicities given by gfantropicalintersection (Sara) 

- Problem with empty polyhedral fan output of gfan. Needs to be recognized.

Status of documentation:

- Should be more documentation.

Status of tests:

- Tests currently run, but only because they are almost entirely commented out.
  Fixing the tests will reveal underlying code issues. Everyone should work 
  on this.

---------------
- Tropical 
---------------

Status of code:

- We'd still like to implement for someone to be able to choose their
  favourite complementary subspace to the lineality space.
- tropicalBasis now works but do we want to get the point outside the variety in case it is not a tropical basis?

Status of documentation:

- README.md page for first time users

- Benefits over gfanInterface.m2

- Documentation of the methods that are not exported + options - what to do

Status of tests:

- Tests run, but there could be more.
